# **Orchids**

## **Overview**
An easily accessible basic resource for people looking for basic plant care and other information specific to orchids.  Initially covering only Phalaenopsis, but hoping to expand and cover more species over time, likely starting with Dendrobium Nobile and Vandaceous orchids.

The pages will initially be crafted in basic html as a static site as this is easy to produce and maintain, and can be hosted for free with GitHub pages.

## Features

### Existing Features

Uniform design across all pages in line with conventional practice.  This incorporates:

* A hamburger menu on mobile (likely to be main source of traffic) which expands to sticky menu on PC. This allows quick and easy navigation of the website.
* A footer which provides a mission statement and back to top button.  This provides a certain and familiar endpoint to every page.
* Consistent, defined design across information delivery sections of the website.  This allows intuitive use of the website through familiarity.
* Every page starts with a hero image, to elicit a positive emotional response.
* The website is designed to be bright and clean with the focus on the information itself.  This allows the user to fulfil their purpose of obtaining knowledge without distraction.
* Androgynous design is deliberately chosen as the content is traditionally seen as feminine.  This helps users who identify as other than female to feel comfortable using the site.
* Where a particular source has provided the base content for any section it is linked to in the bottom right of that section.  This allows the user to explore the information in greater detail should they wish to do so.
* Every page has at least one internal link near the bottom of the page to avoid users becoming "trapped", and to encourage them on their journey through the website.
